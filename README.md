Student Loan Risk Prediction with Deep Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to build a neural network model using deep learning techniques to predict student loan risk based on various features of student data. The core goal is to classify students into different credit ranking categories based on their financial and academic information. The project also includes a discussion on the potential development of a recommendation system to assist students in selecting the best loan options available to them.

The notebook covers several steps:

Data Loading and Exploration: Loading the student loan dataset, reviewing the features, and preprocessing the data.
Feature and Target Definition: Defining the features (input) and the target (output) for the neural network model.
Data Scaling: Standardizing the features using StandardScaler to improve model performance.
Neural Network Model Creation: Building and training a deep learning model using tf.keras to classify credit risk.
Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using classification metrics.
Recommendation System Discussion: Exploring how a student loan recommendation system could be developed.
Technologies and Libraries Used
The following libraries and technologies are used in this project:

Pandas: For data manipulation and exploration.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building the deep learning model.
Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing, splitting the dataset, scaling, and evaluating the model.
Python: The programming language for implementing the neural network model.

Steps in Creating the Neural Network Model

1. Data Preprocessing
Loading the Dataset: The dataset is read into a Pandas DataFrame.
Feature Selection: The input features (X) are defined by selecting all columns except the target column, credit_ranking.
Target Definition: The credit_ranking column serves as the target (y), representing different credit risk levels.
Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split.
Data Scaling: The feature data is scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the input values.

2. Model Creation and Training
Sequential Model: A Sequential model is created using TensorFlow/Keras, which is a simple linear stack of layers.
Layers: The neural network includes:
An input layer (first hidden layer) with 100 nodes and relu activation.
A second hidden layer with 50 nodes and relu activation.
An output layer with 1 neuron and sigmoid activation for binary classification.
Compilation: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metrics.
Training: The model is trained on the scaled training data for 10 epochs with a batch size of 10.

3. Model Evaluation
Predictions: The model's predictions are made on the test data.
Classification Report: A classification report is generated to evaluate the model's performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.

Future Work: Recommendation System
The final section of the project explores the possibility of building a recommendation system to suggest the most appropriate student loan options based on a student's financial and academic background. This would involve collecting data on student demographics, financial status, and loan provider terms, and using content-based or context-based filtering methods to make personalized loan recommendations.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of deep learning for classifying student loan risk using a neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras. It also lays the foundation for developing a recommendation system to assist students in making informed loan decisions.
